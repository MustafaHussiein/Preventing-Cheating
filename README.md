🚀 Preventing Cheating with Electron & .NET – A Cross-Platform Security Solution 🔐

Excited to share a project where I built a secure Electron-based desktop app to prevent cheating in online assessments! 🎯

🔹 Key Features & Security Measures:
✅ Clipboard-based Authentication – Credentials are copied before launch, ensuring access control.
✅ Restricted System Actions – Disabled copy-paste, right-click, and screenshots to prevent leaks.
✅ Network Protection – Blocks VPNs and IP changes to ensure genuine participation.
✅ Cross-Platform Implementation – Leveraging Electron.js for seamless compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
✅ .NET Integration – Ensuring smooth authentication and backend security.

💡 This project showcases expertise in .NET, Web, and Desktop app development, combining security, user authentication, and cross-platform functionality. It was a great experience working with Electron.js while implementing strict anti-cheat mechanisms!

🔍 Looking forward to exploring more security-driven applications in tech! 🚀
